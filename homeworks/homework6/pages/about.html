                <h4>The first paintings </h4>
                The first paintings in the National Gallery collection came from the financier and collector John Julius Angerstein. They consisted of Italian works, including a large altarpiece by Sebastiano del Piombo, The Raising of Lazarus, and fine examples of the Dutch, Flemish and English Schools.

                    <h4>History of the collection</h4>
                    <p>Building the nation’s collection, from the first paintings to the present day
                        When the Gallery was founded in 1824, the first 38 paintings came from the private art collection of the banker <span>John Julius Angerstein</span>.
                        Our world-class collection of paintings has grown considerably over the last two centuries. Today, we have over 2,300 works, spanning the major traditions of Western European painting.

                    <h4>Building a Gallery for all</h4>
                    <p>Why was Trafalgar Square chosen for our location, and how has the building changed through the centuries?
                        The National Gallery found its beginnings in Angerstein’s London townhouse at 100 Pall Mall. It soon became apparent that the paintings would need to be moved to a more substantial location and it was agreed that a new building should be constructed for the national collection. The completed building at Trafalgar Square, designed by the architect William Wilkins, opened as the new home of the National Gallery in 1838.
                        Since this time, numerous alterations and extensions have been made to the original building at Trafalgar Square, creating exciting new spaces.

                    <h4>Collectors and benefactors</h4>
                    <p>How have collectors and benefactors helped to shape and develop the collection? 
                        From the foundation of the National Gallery to the present day, collectors and benefactors have played a key role in the development of the national collection.
                        Whether through the gift of a single painting, a bequest of an entire collection or a major financial donation, the generosity of benefactors has helped to enhance the experience of the Gallery for all its visitors.
